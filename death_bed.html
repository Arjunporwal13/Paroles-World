            <p>Don’t stay awake for too long, don’t go to bed</p>
            <p>I’ll make a cup of coffee for your head</p>
            <p>I’ll get you up and going out of bed</p><br>
            <p>Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away</p>
            <p>I been thinking of our future cause I'll never see those days</p>
            <p>I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it</p>
            <p>I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect</p>
            <p>I been praying for forgiveness, you been praying for my health</p>
            <p>When I leave this earth, hoping you'll find someone else</p>
            <p>Cause yeah, we still young there's so much we haven't done</p>
            <p>Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son</p>
            <p>I wish it could be me, but I won't make it off this bed</p>
            <p>I hope I go to heaven, so I see you once again</p>
            <p>My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings</p>
            <p>Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending</p><br>
            <p>Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed</p>
            <p>I'll make a cup of coffee for your head</p>
            <p>It'll get you up and going out of bed</p><br>
            <p>And I, don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed</p>
            <p>I'll make a cup of coffee for your head</p>
            <p>It'll get you up and going out of bed</p><br>
            <p>I'm happy that you're here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up</p>
            <p>When me and you were younger you would always make me cheer up</p>
            <p>Taking goofy videos while walking through the park</p>
            <p>You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark</p>
            <p>Cuddle in your sheets, sang me sound asleep</p>
            <p>And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03</p>
            <p>Sundays went to church, on Mondays watched a movie</p>
            <p>Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me</p><br>
            <p>Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed</p>
            <p>I'll make a cup of coffee for your head</p>
            <p>It'll get you up and going out of bed</p><br>
            <p>And I, don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed</p>
            <p>I'll make a cup of coffee for your head</p>
            <p>It'll get you up and going out of bed</p><br>
            <p>Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed</p>
            <p>I'll make a cup of coffee for your head</p>
            <p>It'll get you up and going out of bed</p><br>
            <p>And I, don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed</p>
            <p>I'll make a cup of coffee for your head</p>
            <p>It'll get you up and going out of bed</p><br>
            <p>And I, don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed</p>
            <p>I'll make a cup of coffee for your head</p>
            <p>It'll get you up and going out of bed</p><br>
