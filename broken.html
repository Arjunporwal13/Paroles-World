            <p>I'm broken, tell you I'm fine</p>
            <p>But you wouldn't believe me if you knew the things that crossed my mind</p>
            <p>And I'm hurting, but I show no sign</p>
            <p>Cause I'm afraid to give in, break down, and waste your time</p><br>
            <p>Now I'm begging you to come and pull me out the fire</p>
            <p>Come and save me, like you did when we were young</p>
            <p>Oh please, come bring me up from my lowest, take me higher</p>
            <p>Can you see me through the ashes and the smoke?</p><br>
            <p>I'm lonely, it's been so long</p>
            <p>Since I've felt loved, smiled, felt strong</p>
            <p>And what can I do when I'm not friends with my reflection?</p>
            <p>When I don't understand affection like you do?</p><br>
            <p>I'm begging you to come and pull me out the fire</p>
            <p>Come and save me like you did when we were young</p>
            <p>Oh please, come bring me up from my lowest, take me higher</p>
            <p>Can you see me through the ashes and the smoke?</p><br>
            <p>You say that you'll help me, tell me I'm worth it</p>
            <p>But I don't deserve it, I don't deserve it</p>
            <p>It's easy for you cause you know you're perfect</p>
            <p>And I need your hand, but I don't want to burn it</p>
            <p>There's blood on the counter and tears on the pages</p>
            <p>While I write you a letter, and then I quickly erase it</p>
            <p>I'm shattered and beat down, broken and weak, now</p><br>
            <p>So I'm begging you to come and pull me out the fire</p>
            <p>Come quickly 'cause I'm burning up inside</p>
            <p>Oh please, just bring me up from my lowest, take me higher</p>
            <p>Can you see me through the ashes and the smoke?</p><br>
            <p>Pull me out</p>
            <p>Pull me out</p>
            <p>Pull me</p><br>
